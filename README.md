# ChemClipse

The Eclipse Chemclipse project offers functionality for data reading and processing in the domain of
Cheminformatics and Bioinformatics.
Currently it offers workflows in the following areas:
* chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC/MS)
* flame-ionization detectors (GC/FID)
* real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
* nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
thanks to the open and flexible architecture more are possible and we are open for ideas and suggestions see our [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/eclipse/chemclipse/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md).

[Chemclipse](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/science.chemclipse) is part of the [Eclipse Science](https://science.eclipse.org/) working group and is the basis for [OpenChrom®](https://github.com/Openchrom/openchrom).

For user- and developer documentation, have a look at our [wiki](https://github.com/eclipse/chemclipse/wiki), if you have questions or need guidelines you can contact contact the project developers via the [project's "dev" list](https://dev.eclipse.org/mailman/listinfo/chemclipse-dev).
