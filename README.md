# ChemClipse

The Eclipse ChemClipse project offers functionality for data reading and processing in the domain of
Cheminformatics and Bioinformatics.
Currently it offers workflows in the following areas:
* chromatography
  * coupled with mass spectrometry (GC/MS)
  * flame-ionization detectors (GC/FID)
  * wavelength-selective detectors (HPLC-DAD/UV-Vis)
  * vibrational-spectroscopy detectors (GC-IR, HPLC-Raman)
* mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS)
* molecular spectroscopy
  * nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
  * vibrational spectroscopy
    * infrared spectroscopy (FTIR, NIR, MIR)
    * raman spectroscopy (Raman)
  * ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy (UV/Vis)
* molecular biology
  * real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)

Thanks to the open and flexible architecture more are possible and we are open for ideas and suggestions see our [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/eclipse/chemclipse/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md).

[ChemClipse](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/science.chemclipse) is part of the [Eclipse Science](https://science.eclipse.org/) working group and is the basis for [OpenChrom®](https://github.com/Openchrom/openchrom).

For user- and developer documentation, have a look at our [wiki](https://github.com/eclipse/chemclipse/wiki), if you have questions or need guidelines you can contact contact the project developers via the [project's "dev" list](https://dev.eclipse.org/mailman/listinfo/chemclipse-dev). See [Jenkins](https://ci.eclipse.org/chemclipse/) for continous integration builds.
